# Intro

> Hello everyone, this is the official xlang programming language source code repository.

Today, 12/01/2022, I created this repository, from here my journey into the world of computer science and fundamental programming begins. `XLANG` is my first non-commercial project - a `multi-functional` and `multi-paradigm` programming language with `static typing` and `manual memory management`.

In `folder docs/` you can see demo.

> As the project grows, information and various links will appear here.
